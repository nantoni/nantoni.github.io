&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first day Emilia Pecheanu took Fran√ßois and I to Wind River, she knows a few people there, in fact the general manager, Luminita, is also an IT professor in the same department as Mrs. Pecheanu.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were warmly welcomed by the first floor employees and Adriana Tudor, Facility Manager, walked us through mandatory paperwork. We had now our badges and Adriana took us on a tour of the building that ended by the discovery of our desks on the 3rd floor were there are also the WEB and internationals relations team.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our manager, Liviu Stanescu, was in the United States for a formation along with some other managers. So.. we had a few days to discover the facilities and to get to know our colleagues.
