description: At the end of the second UIT's semester I heard about the possibility to make a foreign internship.

We were told by our Englishg teacher that the UIT had a few contacts in Ireland and Romania to apply for an internship.

I saw that as a great opportunity to experience working on a foreign-speaking environment in order to challenge my versatility and to enhance my English level.   

Choosing Romania over Ireland was and easy choice; I had never been in an Easter European country and I was eager to get an insight of the culture of this region.   

To plan this I had to reach to Mrs. Pecheanu; she's an operating system teacher at the Galati university in Romania and she's been teaching me operating system at the UIT during the first semester. I got to her via e-mail and we planned a meeting before she went back in Romania. She was extremely helpful and immediately offered to take care of paperwork with the university, the accommodation as well as giving my resume to a company in Galati.

Fast-forward few weeks, two other classmates, François and Pierre, applied for an internship in Romania, François and I were accepted in a company called _Wind River_ and Pierre was accepted at an other company called _The cloud_ and we were now doing a lot of paperwork, with the much appreciated help from Mrs. Hassouline at the UIT foreign relations bureau, to make this happen.
