&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the context of my internship I was offered to do this blog about my experience in Romania instead of a plain text report solely on my work at the company.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw this as an opportunity to sharpen my web skills, as well as to advertise how an internship abroad is a priceless experience.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first started to look at the various free options to host a website. It turned out that [Github](https://github.com/), that I'm familiar with because I used it a lot for the version control and code-sharing of the many team projects we had at the IUT, is offering a free solution to host your static website.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the fact that it is a blog it does not need to have server-side code being ran, so I went for this option.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Github-hosted sites works with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) a static site generator developed by Github's founder. It allowed me to discover this tool, along with the [Liquid](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/115244038-an-overview-of-liquid-shopifys-templating-language) template language that is supported by Jekyll.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was also a great way to work with HTML and CSS that I hadn't had the chance to work too much with during my DUT.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were allowed to use the company's facility after our working hours to work on personal projects, so we did stay late to work on our blogs. The environment is favorable to productivity, it has free coffee, and it has an air conditioner, which there is not in our accommodation, and working in a really hot environment is challenging.
