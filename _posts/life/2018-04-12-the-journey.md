We departed from Strasbourg in the morning to go to the Mulhouse-Basel airport by car.

We managed to find a direct flight from there to Bucharest for about 160â‚¬ with extra luggage fees.

Three hours of flight later we were in Bucharest and we had to go near the train station _Bucharesti Nord_ were the Hostel we booked the night in was located. It was an hour drive and the bus was only 3lei (less than a euro) which is nice.

The Hostel was pretty nice and social-friendly. There was a fourth guy whom we shared our room with, Gerth, a retired German who was traveling through eastern Europe doing street art and drawing landscapes on paper when he wasn't out. While cooking diner in the shared kitchen we met a girl from Strasbourg who had just come back from India as well as a Belgian guy traveling Europe. Hostels are such a great place to meet open minded people from all over the world.

Next morning we had a nice breakfast, got ready and went to get our train. It was full so we had to do the 4h30 hour long travel seated in between the last car and outside. But it got us to meet other young people that took their ticket at the last moment and had to travel on the train floor.
