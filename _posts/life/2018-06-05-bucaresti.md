&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He offered to visit me in Romania for a few days, neither of us had seen Bucarest (for more than a few hours I mean), so we planned to meet there. He brought along a childhood friend, Henry, a really nice guy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We wandered around, trying to capture the essence of the city, which is much more vivid than in Galati. It seems like a dynamic city full of youth.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the communism has been over for almost 30 years, the huge full-concrete buildings that remains reminds you well that it has once been the prevailing ideology.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stayed in an apartment we booked through Booking.com, although the building looked like a communist remains, it had been renovated into a neat and modern apartment.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One night we came back late, we took the communist-age elevator to go to the apartment on the 6th floor, and it got blocked in between two floors, with the door locked, and of course without an elevator emergency alarm. Hopefully the owner walked us through a way to unlock the door from within the elevator via a phone call and saved the night.
