&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there is no bridge you have to take the private-owned ferry boat to go on the other side. One ride is 0.33â‚¬ if you don't cross with a car.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went there with Kevin our Albanian friend from the student accommodation. The place is a lot less developed than Galati, not having a bridge is a constraint that blocks them from easily accessing the city and restrain they growth. It was mainly farmers and free-range farms with pigs, cows, sheep and chickens.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While walking we encountered a farmer with its carriage and he kindly offered to take us to a nice place to take a walk. Luckily Kevin spoke a bit of Romanian and did the translation for us.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was mostly wilderness there, so after the sun had set we came back to Galati and went to our favorite Italian restaurant there.
