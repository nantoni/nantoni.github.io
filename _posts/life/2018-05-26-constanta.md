description: It's been more than a month since we were in Galati, and we hadn't had the chance to visit another place.. yet we tried.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{ page.description }}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, we first wanted to go to lake Iacobdeal by bike, on a Sunday, only to find out that the only shop that rents bike in Galati was closed on Sunday.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We then checked the buses to go there, but apparently the only bus that goes from Galati to a city near Iacobdeal departs at 5:00 in the morning. We then lowered our expectation and found a bus that goes to Braila, a city that is only 20km away from Galati. We went to the bus station, asked a lady there how to get to Braila, she walked us to the driver just to be told that he was done driving for the day; what a disappointment it was.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next weekend we were more motivated than ever to rent a car in order to go somewhere, and Iacobdeal was our main goal. We did the 3 places where you can rent cars in Galati just to be told that we hadn't enough driving experience... there goes another failure.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the orthodox Pentecost: Monday was a free day and we had a 3 days weekend, what a great occasion to visit the sea side! But this time we decided to rely on the train.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we took the train to go to Constanta. Its a 4-hour long commute from Galati even tho it is only 150km away. Transportation is a huge issue in Romania, as their only international airport is the one in Bucarest and the train is insanely slow. In fact, the average speed for a train in Romania is 45km/hour... This is due to a lack of investment in the rail network.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stayed 2 nights in a AirBnB apartment near the beach for 38â‚¬ a night. The beds were much more comfortable than the ones we have at our accommodation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the hot weather we were under since our arrival, we hadn't had the occasion to take a swim; me made up for that by diving into the watter of the black see. We did not see many people in the water as it felt really cold at first, but god it felt good.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the evening plans; our friend Mara had recommended us the Goblin club in Constanta, and we were not at all disappointed. The music was really great, the design was enjoyable and the mood was rather relaxed. We even witnessed Moldavians fighting in front of the club...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day we took a walk in the old city center of Constanta, the weather was favorable and we took advantage of it to take place on the terrace of the fanciest restaurant we went to so far.
