&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foodwise, you can have a really great value for your money in Romania. There are a few nice places in Galati that cook decent pizzas and pasta, and for about 6,90€ you can have a good dish and a pint of Romanian beer. We never had a really good dessert in any restaurants tho.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, of course, some fast-foods like _Passage_ where you can get a triple schnitzel tacos for 2,20€, but if you want to go extra cheap there's nothing better than the university canteen; You can have a schnitzel with some beans and bread for 0,70€ and it is rather good. If you are not that hungry have a soup and some bread for 0,45€. The only downsides are that it is only open for lunch and not on weekends.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you feel like having a taste of typical Romanian food, the best way is, of course, to be invited at locals. We had the chance to taste a home-made chicken soup at a young Romanian place. The guy spent a few month in France so
