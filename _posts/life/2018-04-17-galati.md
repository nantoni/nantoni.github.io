&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city is an industrial city due to the arcelormittal plant, being the first steel producer of Romania and employing about 7,000 employees in Galati, it is a pillar of the local economy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center is rather small and the city is not really modern overall, but it has its appeal. Sadly, there are a lot of old buildings that are being abandoned, either because the state or the private owner don't want to bother spending money on maintaining such a building.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To move inside the city you can walk, I find Galati's streets charming, but for longer commute there is a well developed bus network (the ride costs 0.45€), there is a tram but it only operates about 3 times a day or there are the taxis, these are everywhere across Romania and they are really cheap (these are 0.42€/km), the 2 main companies in Galati are SAMATAXI and AS, and going around taking a cab is mainstream all over Romania.
