&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{ page.description }}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our colleague Alina and her husband Gabi offered to take us on a day-long road trip. The plan was to go to Tulcea, see the Danube's delta, then the Enisala Fortress, then head over to the Argamum Fortress, and end up with the Iacobdeal lake.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once in Tulcea we found a guy with a small boat that took us on a 4-hour long ride in the Danube's delta.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wildlife is breathtaking there, the only human-made things that we came across were some other boats and a few fisherman's house. The boat's captain took us to see an area full of lily flower and another filled with cormorants. Just touring in the delta by boat was amazing by itself.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this sneak peak into Romanian's wildlife, we went to have a lunch in a small city not too far. The next stop was then Enisala.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a medieval-age fortress located on top of a hill in order to see any incoming siege from a distance. It now means that you have an amazing view on all the surrounding landscapes including Razim lake, Romania's biggest lake (about 29km long and 15km wide).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next stop was the Argamum city, these are remains from an old Greeks city. There is not much left of any of the buildings, it is mostly the base of the walls but it allows you to imagine how the city was organized. It is also located near the huge Razim lake.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We then headed to the Iacobdeal lake. We had heard of it from our friend Alex that is part of the band we saw rehearsing. There is a cool story behind this lake, it was a granite open mine and while dynamiting the rock they broke into a natural water network that filled the cup-shaped mine with water in a few days. It is now a beautiful lake where people come to barbecue and jump from high cliffs into the cold water. We took a well-deserved swim as the sun was setting.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We then went to eat grilled meat in Braila, a city next to Galati, before going back to our accommodation, very thankful for this amazing day.
